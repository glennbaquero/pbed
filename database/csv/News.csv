"K to 12 grads find employment thru First Future","Abby Liwanag","<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The implementation of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7iYZn6XDns"">K-12 curriculum</a> in the country drew negative reactions from various societal groups. Since 2011, critics have been very vocal on their primary concerns. They insist the government isn’t yet ready for this new system and that this is more of additional burden to students and their parents.</p><p style=""text-align:justify;"">Despite calls to suspend the program, the government remained firm saying this new educational system offers opportunities for Filipino students and the national economy.</p><p style=""text-align:justify;"">For its part, the Department of Education (DepEd) stresses that the country is prepared for a big shift in education system. In fact, it has worked to fulfill the gaps on the number of classrooms, teachers, and textbooks. Also, it has finished the planning phases along with stakeholders.</p><p style=""text-align:justify;"">But what does K-12 scheme really has to offer to students?</p><p style=""text-align:justify;"">To prove that K-12 system is more than just adding two more years to high school, below are three of the many practical benefits of schooling under a 13-year education cycle:</p><ol><li style=""text-align:justify;""><i><strong>Preparedness for tertiary learning</strong> </i>– With adaptation of K-12 scheme, students are expected to graduate at age a bit older than past graduates’. This is an advantage, according to DepEd, as graduates will be considered young adults. Hence, they will be more equipped to deal with much higher level of learning as they enter college education.</li><li style=""text-align:justify;""><i><strong>Readiness to join the workforce</strong></i> – Unlike the old system, K-12 does not compel each student to take college after completing Senior High School (SHS). In fact, this scheme empowers students to make a choice on their own. They may not pursue college education especially if they have chosen a track other than academic track. The good thing is SHS graduates will be equipped with skills (through electives) that will make them good at certain field(s).</li><li style=""text-align:justify;""><i><strong>Skill competency in the global job market</strong> </i>– K-12 system aims to improve Filipino students’ mathematical, scientific, and linguistic competence. With the new curriculum, DepEd promised to offer higher quality education through tracks. Each track will give students enough time to master a field and enhance their skills. In the end, K-12 graduates will become globally competitive and are set to obtain spot in the stiff labor market.</li></ol><p style=""text-align:justify;"">The government believes that <a href=""http://k12philippines.com/"">K to 12 curriculum in the Philippines</a> will put Filipino students at par with the rest of the world. Truly, investing in education is the key toward reaching national growth and development.</p>","news-images/5edeed33d1394KwEqddP7Ryi646JA2rVpDQsuKUiUbqp9SrvRUMLI.png",1
